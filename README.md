# Akave SDK CLI

The **Akave SDK CLI** (`akavesdk`) is a command-line tool designed to streamline interactions with Akave's decentralized storage platform. With this SDK, developers can efficiently manage buckets, upload and download files, and interact with metadata across Akave nodes. It supports both standard API operations and an advanced streaming API for high-performance file management, as well as an IPC API for blockchain-based data operations.

Whether you're building a new integration or managing data across nodes, this SDK provides robust capabilities to help you achieve seamless, scalable storage solutions.

## Build and test instructions
Requirements: Go 1.25+

`make build` - outputs a cli binary into `bin/akavecli`.<br>
`make test` - runs tests.<br>
Look at `Makefile` for details.

### Akave Node IPC API

The Akave Node IPC API provides access to gRPC service that interacts with Akave node, and IPC deployed smart-contract that operates with metadata.
Uses same File, Bucket, Block and Chunk models as regular Akave Node API

        Name      string
        CreatedAt *big.Int
        Owner     common.Address

        BucketId  [32]byte
        Name      string
        Size      *big.Int
        CreatedAt *big.Int
        Blocks    [][32]byte
    }
    ```

# SDK

### SDK DAG utilities
- `ChunkDAG` a struct that contains node's(in context of a DAG) metainformation: CID, sizes, block metadata
- `DAGRoot` helps to build file's root CID. On each file chunk you have to add a link to chunk(specifiying chunk's CID and its node sizes)
- `BuildDAG` build `ChunkDAG` from a given file. This DAG is of flat structure, meaning it has 1 root and all blocks are children of this single root

- **Bucket Management**: Create, view, list, and delete buckets.
- **File Management**: Upload, download, view, list, and delete files.
- **Wallet Management**: Create and manage wallets for Akave storage transactions, import/export private keys and check balances.

Encryption key in flag `-e`(or `--encryption-key` in long form) for upload and download file commands is optional, without using it data will be unencrypted. Key must be a hex encoded string.
The key length **must be 32 bytes** long.
